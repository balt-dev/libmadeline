# libmadeline demo

This is a simple program written in C that demonstrates the library, and how to hook into it.

## Building

In order to build, you need to have `SDL2` installed, and then you can link against both it and `libmadeline` to compile.
A compiled `.exe` is also in the `dist` directory.
