# libmadeline demo

This is a simple program written in C that demonstrates the library, and how to hook into it.

## Building

In order to build, you need to have `SDL2` installed, and then you can link against both it and `libmadeline` to compile.

Running `./make.sh` in the root of the repository will put the files needed for `libmadeline` in this directory.
