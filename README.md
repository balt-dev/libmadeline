Programmers don't do things because they're easy. We do them because we _thought_ they'd be easy.

Puts the movement code (graphics not included) of Madeline from Celeste into a DLL you can include in just about anything!



Only a subset of the possible player states are programmed in (`Normal`, `Dash`, `Climb`, and `Swim`), and
the implementation does not do some assistance that the base game does,
meaning that _this will not run your TAS'es,_ sorry to say - this is more meant for casual play. Among these unimplemented things are holdable objects (e.g. Theo).

Also, climbhopping is unimplemented
because it's janky and annoying and really hard to get right.
You instead do a climb jump without spending stamina for it.

That being said, all movement tech that doesn't depend on these does work (to my knowledge)!
You can go and do your chained ultras and reverse supers and all that jazz all you want.


## Usage

You can find a copy of the library in the `dist` folder, and an example project in the `demo` folder.

In order to get an instance of Madeline, you need to call `CLST_Init`, which will give you a pointer to a Madeline object.

**DO NOT `delete` OR `free()` THIS POINTER.**

When you are done with it, pass it to `CLST_Drop`, which will safely discard it.

In order to update Madeline's state, set the `input` field as needed according to player input,
and then call `CLST_Tick` with the elapsed time since the last tick.
